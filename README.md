##Short Description
> In this assignment we are focusing on implementing various sorting functions, including Quick sort, Shell sort, Batcher Sort, and Heap sort. We will also be implementing our own test harness to analyze the amount of moves and time required for these sorting functions to run.   

##Build
> To build, run `make` or `make all` on the command line in the assignment directory.

##Run
> To run the program, use the command ./sorting in the command line in the assignment directory. This should be done after the make command was entered. Within the test harness, there are many flags to parse through various functions. Adding any of the following commands `-a -b -h -q -s -r` will enable the user to view data on the test harness. Each flag refers to a specific function. Using the command -h will give the user more information regarding the usage of flags.

##Clean 
> To clean the program, use the command `make clean` in the command line. This will remove any executable and .o files from the directory.
